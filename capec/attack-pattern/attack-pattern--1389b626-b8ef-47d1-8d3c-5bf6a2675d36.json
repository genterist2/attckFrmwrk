            "description": "An adversary uses stolen hash values for a user's credentials (username and password) to access systems managed under the same credential framwork that leverage the Lan Man (LM) and/or NT Lan Man (NTLM) authentication protocols. When authenticating via LM or NTLM, the hashed credentials' associated plaintext credentials are not requried for successful authentication. Therefore, if an adversary can obtain the hashed credentials of a user, he can then pass these hash values to the server or service to authenticate without needing to brute-force the hashes to obtain their cleartext values. The adversary can then impersonate the user and laterally move within the network. This technique can be performed against any operating system which leverages the LM or NTLM protocols.",
