The adversary must be able to observe, read, and/or hear the communication traffic, but not necessarily block the communication or change its content. The adversary may precipitate or indirectly influence the content of the observed transaction, but is never the intended recipient of the information. Any transmission medium can theoretically be sniffed if the adversary can examine the contents between the sender and recipient.",
